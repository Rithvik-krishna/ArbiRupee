# Withdrawal Balance Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## 🎯 **Issue Identified and Resolved**

The withdrawal functionality was not updating the user's balance after processing withdrawals.

### ❌ **The Problem**
- Withdrawals were being logged but not actually deducting from the user's balance
- The withdrawal endpoint was only showing a success message without updating the database
- User balance remained unchanged after withdrawals

### ✅ **The Solution**
Updated the withdrawal endpoint to properly process withdrawals and update the user's balance:

```javascript
// POST /api/withdraw - Mock withdrawal processing
router.post('/', authenticateWallet, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { amount, accountHolder, accountNumber, ifsc, bankName } = req.body;
    const user = req.user;
    
    // Validate withdrawal amount
    if (!amount || amount <= 0) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        message: 'Invalid withdrawal amount'
      });
    }
    
    // Check user's current balance
    const currentBalance = await blockchainService.getTokenBalance(user.walletAddress);
    
    if (currentBalance < amount) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        message: 'Insufficient balance for withdrawal'
      });
    }
    
    // Mock withdrawal processing
    console.log(`Mock withdrawal: ${amount} for ${accountHolder} (${accountNumber})`);
    
    // Update user statistics to deduct the withdrawal amount
    await user.updateStatistics({
      type: 'withdraw',
      amount: amount
    });
    
    console.log(`✅ Mock withdrawal completed: ${amount} arbINR withdrawn from ${user.walletAddress}`);
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      message: "Withdrawal request submitted and processed!",
      data: {
        amount: amount,
        newBalance: currentBalance - amount
      }
    });
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Mock withdrawal error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Failed to process withdrawal',
      error: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Balance Validation**
- **Before**: No balance checking before withdrawal
- **After**: Validates sufficient balance before processing

### 2. **Database Updates**
- **Before**: Only logging withdrawal, no database updates
- **After**: Properly updates user statistics with withdrawal amount

### 3. **Balance Calculation**
- **Before**: Balance not being deducted
- **After**: Balance calculated as `totalDeposited - totalWithdrawn`

### 4. **Response Data**
- **Before**: Generic success message
- **After**: Returns withdrawal amount and new balance

## 🧪 **Testing Confirmed**

### **Withdrawal API Test**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Withdrawal request submitted and processed!",
  "data": {
    "amount": 1000,
    "newBalance": 51500
  }
}
```

### **Balance Verification**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "address": "0xBeaC2A86Cdcf05303630c2bC1bE8612F2353942F",
    "balance": 51500,
    "balanceFormatted": "51,500",
    "usdValue": "584.57",
    "inrValue": "51500.00"
  }
}
```

### **Balance Change Confirmed**
- **Before Withdrawal**: 52,500 arbINR
- **After Withdrawal**: 51,500 arbINR
- **Deduction**: 1,000 arbINR ✅
