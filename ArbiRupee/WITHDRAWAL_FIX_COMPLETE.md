# Withdrawal Issue - FIXED ✅

## Status: PROBLEM RESOLVED

The withdrawal functionality has been successfully fixed and is now working correctly.

## 🔧 **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### 1. **Field Name Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Frontend was sending `ifsc` but form field was `ifscCode`
- **Solution**: Updated POST request to use `ifsc: ifscCode`

### 2. **Validation Logic** ✅ IMPROVED
- **Problem**: Validation was too strict and not providing clear feedback
- **Solution**: Enhanced validation with better error handling and debugging

### 3. **Button Styling** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Button was showing gray (disabled) state incorrectly
- **Solution**: Fixed button styling to properly show enabled/disabled states

### 4. **Debugging Added** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Problem**: No visibility into what was causing validation failures
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
